# PivotTables are excellent. Example code below for the Titanic dataset:

import numpy as np

# Let's compute the survival change from 0-1 for people in each class
# The closer to one, the higher the chance people in that passenger class survived
# The "survived" column contains a 1 if the passenger survived, and a 0 if not
# The pivot_table method on a pandas dataframe will let us do this
# index specifies which column to subset data based on (in this case, we want to compute the survival percentage for each class)
# values specifies which column to subset based on the index
# The aggfunc specifies what to do with the subsets
# In this case, we split survived into 3 vectors, one for each passenger class, and take the mean of each
passenger_survival = titanic_survival.pivot_table(index="pclass", values="survived", aggfunc=np.mean)

# First class passengers had a much higher survival chance
print(passenger_survival)

passenger_age = titanic_survival.pivot_table(index="pclass", values="age", aggfunc=np.mean)

print(passenger_age)
