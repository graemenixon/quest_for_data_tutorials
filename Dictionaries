#Creating dictionaries:

names = {}

#Setting values in the dictionary:

names["Graeme"] = 1
names["Jennifer"] = 2
names["Zane"] = 3

print(names)
# returns: {"Graeme":1 , "Jennifer":2 , "Zane":3}

# You can look up a variable by referencing it as so:

count_graeme = names["Graeme"]
# will return: 1

# Easier of defining a dictionary:

names{
  "Graeme" : 1,
  "Jennifer" : 2,
  "Zane" : 3
}
# Note the commas...

# Modifying values is easy:
# This re-assings the value
names["Graeme"] = 5
# While this would update the value:
names["Graeme"] = names["Graeme"] + 5

# Looking for items: you can use the 'in' function to look for something in a dictionary, which will return a Boolean

"Graeme" in names
# returns True

# Counting with dictionaries:

pantry = ["apple", "orange", "grape", "apple", "orange", "apple", "tomato", "potato", "grape"]
pantry_counts = {}

for item in pantry:
    if item in pantry_counts:
        pantry_counts[item] = pantry_counts[item] + 1
    else:
        pantry_counts[item] = 1
